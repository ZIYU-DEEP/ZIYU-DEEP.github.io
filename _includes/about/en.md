Hey, this is Ziyu, a pursuer of machine intelligence.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at The University of Chicago](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/). Before this, I completed my Master of Science degree of [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) there. I had my Bachelor of Economics degree at [The Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young).

<!-- My research and working experience is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuye/). My detailed CV is available upon request. -->

In doing research, I was primarily driven by the curiosity to understand the learning mechanism of intelligence. The development of deep learning applications have influenced the quality of our life greatly in the last decade, however, the theoretical foundations of intelligence is far from established. There are lots of questions needed to be answered, and more questions needed to be asked. My goal is to identify and solve for the problems critical to understand learning mechanisms, and generalize principles useful for us to design better intelligent machines, which really think / learn / communicate with humans, as Shannon imagined a few decades ago. I understand the future work to be done by the 4 steps: to identify, to understand, to abstract, and to generalize.

Besides this, I am interested in economics, which provides powerful analytical tools in understanding outcomes by intelligent agents. Economics helps design high-level policies for real-world living problems, which improve social welfare. While I am studying the highly abstract problems as mentioned previously, I often, irrelevantly, feel a sense of guilty for those human beings suffering from mundane life problems (e.g. poverty, political oppression, etc.). I've spent some time in rural mountain areas and observed the difficulty for some people to "live" with dignity. In future, I hope I could also contribute my efforts to those problems and those people, instead of just staying comfortably with abstract machine thoughts.

I am a fan of [Ellen Loo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Joyce_Loo) and [Joyce Koi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%93%8B%E9%B3%B4%E6%9A%89).
