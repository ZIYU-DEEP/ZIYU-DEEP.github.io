<!-- # Although perhaps of no practical importance, the question is of theoretical interest, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of a similar nature and of greater significance.

# Chemistry has always seemed a little dull to me â€” too many isolated facts and too few general principles for my taste.

# The fundamental discoveries of such scientists are wonderful achievements in themselves, but would not affect the life of the common man without the intermediate efforts of engineers and inventorsâ€•people like Edison, Bell and Marconi.

# I see no limit to the capabilities of machines.

# I have great hopes in this direction for machines that will rival or even surpass the human brain.

# My fondest dream is to someday build a machine that really thinks, learns, communicates with humans and manipulate its environment in a fairly sophisticated way. -->

## ðŸ•¹ Bio

Hey, this is Ziyu, a pursuer of machine intelligence.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en/who-we-are/global-impact/accolades/nobel-laureates). Before this, I completed my Master of Science degree of [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) there. I had my Bachelor of Economics degree at [The Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young). Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S2da4LUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuye/) page.

<!-- My research and working experience is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziyuye/). My detailed CV is available upon request. -->

In doing research, I was primarily driven by the curiosity to understand the learning mechanism of intelligence. The development of deep learning applications have influenced the quality of our life greatly in the last decade, however, the theoretical foundations of intelligence is far from established. There are lots of questions needed to be answered, and more questions needed to be asked. My goal is to identify and solve for the problems critical to understand learning mechanisms, and generalize principles useful for us to design better intelligent machines, which really think / learn / communicate with humans, as Shannon imagined a few decades ago. I understand the future work to be done by the 4 steps: to identify, to understand, to abstract, and to generalize.

Besides, I am interested in economics, which provides powerful analytical tools in understanding agent behaviors, and helps design high-level policies for real-world living problems (c.f., [Chicago Boys](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chicago_Boys)). While I am studying the highly abstract problems as mentioned above, I often feel a sense of guilty for human beings suffering from mundane life problems (e.g. poverty, political oppression, etc.). I've spent some time in rural mountain areas and observed the difficulty for many of us to "live" with dignity. In future, I wish to also contribute my efforts to those problems and people, instead of just staying comfortably with abstract machine thoughts.

I am a fan of [Ellen Loo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Joyce_Loo).
